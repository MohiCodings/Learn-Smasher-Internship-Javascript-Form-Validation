# Login Form with Form Validation

This is a simple login form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
The form includes form validation to ensure that the user enters valid input before submitting the form.<br>
It was developed as an internship task to showcase my skills in  web development.

## Getting Started

To use the login form, follow these steps:

1. Download or copy the code from this repository.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Form Validation
The form includes the following validations:

If the user submits the form without entering valid input, error messages will be displayed next to the corresponding fields.
